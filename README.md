This is a simple implementation of the Gossip Protocol in Python. The goal of this small project is to learn how multiple nodes can communicate with each other in a decentralized way. The idea for the structure of this implementation comes from here: https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/95671/gossip-algorithm-in-distributed-systems/282643#282643.

# Usage

Place all files in the same directory and run all the scripts independently, in a different terminal window/session. To visualize this better, you can use a tool like Tmux or similar, which is used in the GIF below. Note that the Gossip.py file does not need to be run, only the Node_50xx.py do.

# Explanation

If you want to learn more about the Gossip protocol, this is where I got most of my information: https://nakamoto.com/gnutella/.
